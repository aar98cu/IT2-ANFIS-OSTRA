# IT2-ANFIS-OSTRA
This repository provides an implementation of an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) using the One-Step Type Reduction Algorithm (OSTRA) in MATLAB. The model is designed for fuzzy modeling applications, leveraging generalized bell-shaped membership functions tailored to IT2 fuzzy logic principles.
