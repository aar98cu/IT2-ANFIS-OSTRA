# IT2-ANFIS OSTRA for Fuzzy Modeling

This repository contains an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) with the One-Step Type Reduction Algorithm (OSTRA) implemented in MATLAB. This model leverages generalized bell-shaped membership functions specific to IT2 fuzzy logic, providing robust modeling capabilities, particularly in scenarios with high uncertainty.

## Features

- **Generalized Bell IT2 Membership Functions**: Flexibility in shaping membership functions, allowing the model to accommodate various data distributions effectively.
- **One-Step Type Reduction (OSTRA)**: A custom, efficient type-reduction algorithm designed to minimize computational load while delivering precise outputs.
- **Adaptable Fuzzy Modeling**: Suitable for autonomous navigation, robotics, and other applications that require adaptive fuzzy modeling in dynamic environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:
- **MATLAB** (R2020a or later is recommended for compatibility with all functions and toolboxes).
- **Fuzzy Logic Toolbox** (for IT2 operations and membership function design).
- **Neural Network Toolbox** (for ANFIS structure).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/IT2-ANFIS-OSTRA.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

```bash
cd IT2-ANFIS-OSTRA
```
