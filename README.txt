The contents of this folder are as follows:

Input:
	Contains the training data of the 3 examples shown in the paper.

Model:
	In this folder, when the modelling with IT2-ANFIS OSTRA is finished, the obtained IT2 model is saved as an .m file, which can be used in MATLAB directly. In addition, the results of the approximation, the MF's and the RMSE obtained are automatically saved in the Figure folder.

IT2-ANFIS OSTRA files.

The steps for the execution of the code are as follows:

1.- To run the IT2-ANFIS OSTRA algorithm open the main.m file and edit line 6 with the filename without the file extension. 
2.- Run the code.
